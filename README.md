Simply No Shading is a [Fabric]-based [modification] (<abbr>mod</abbr>) for the [Minecraft] [client]. This mod removes the darkening on sides or faces (also known as [shading]) to in-game objects such as blocks, clouds, and (block) entities (experimental) as illustrated below: TODO

Disabling shading results in a brighter environment, especially to blocks. Similar results for blocks can be achieved using [OptiFine], though **not** recommended for underpowered hardware, and by turning `Options > Video Settings > Shaders... > (internal) > Old Lighting` to `ON`. A similar simple mod [Flat Lighting] achieves similar results for blocks and supports Sodium as of version [`1.2.0`].

## Compatibility

Simply No Shading provides active compatibility for [BedrockIfy] and [Sodium]. Some mods that provide or replace stuff may work such as [Enhanced Block Entities] (<abbr>EBE</abbr>), where block entities acts like blocks and are affected as such when toggling shading.

Some mods that replace rendering are most likely incompatible; exceptions are ones that have active support for such as Sodium, for example. One example incompatibility are shaders, usually applied using [Iris].

Simply No Shading recently added active support for the latest minor updates to major releases along with the some April Fool's snapshots. Following are all those versions: [`1.14.4`], [`1.15.2`], [`20w14infinite`], [`1.16.5`], [`1.17.1`], [`1.18.2`], [`22w13oneblockatatime`], [`1.19.4`], [`23w13a_or_b`], [`1.20`], [`1.20.1`], [`1.20.2`], and [`1.20.3`]. All minor releases for the latest major version is supported while (most) snapshots loses support when superseded by more recent updates.
